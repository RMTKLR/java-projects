For a while, Pooh and the "Floating Bear" could not decide which of them should be on top,
but in the end they agreed.The "Floating Bear" turned out to be at the bottom, and on it -
Pooh, desperately dangling his legs. Christopher Robin lived in the highest part of the Forest.
It rained and rained and rained, but the water couldn't get to his house.
And, perhaps, it was quite fun to look down and admire all this water,
but the rain was so heavy that Christopher Robin sat
at home almost all the time and thought about different things.
